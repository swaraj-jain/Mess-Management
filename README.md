## Problem Statement 
In our world today, 95% of the populations suffers from some kind of disease. Treatment of a disease involves multiple visits to hospitals and clinics whether be it for treatment or for medicinal purposes.
In such cases, maintaining a record for treatments and medicines becomes a rather cumbersome process and is prone to mistake and carelessness. 



## Solution
DocPat is a platform for Doctors and Patients.It provides a platform for doctors and patient to interact with each other. It makes storing, managing and serving records easier for both patient and doctors. Patients can also search for doctors as well as create reminders like next visit to hospital , Medicine need to order etc.
